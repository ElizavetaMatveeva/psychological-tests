This C program offers user to take a psychological test. It asks user which test they would want to take, then, depending on their answer, works with one of the files containing the following: name of the chosen test, questions, answer options, and final results. The program prints questions, reads user's answers, counts which result fits user's personality the best, and prints out that result.
